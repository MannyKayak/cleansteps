# Clean Steps

## Game Description

**Clean Steps** is a fun and strategic game where the player takes on two roles:
1. **Dog Owner**: Selects up to 16 spots where the dog leaves "presents" in the park.
2. **Passerby**: Needs to cross the park and reach the exit while stepping on as few "presents" as possible.

The exit is randomly generated on the left edge of the canvas, while the passerby spawns on the right edge. The passerby can move one step at a time by clicking on points within the canvas.

### Objective of the Game

- **For the Dog Owner**: Create a strategic path of "presents" to make it challenging for the passerby.
- **For the Passerby**: Reach the exit while making as many clean steps as possible. The ideal goal is to make 16 clean steps without stepping on any "presents."

## How to Play

1. **Dog Owner**:
   - Select up to 16 points in the park where the dog will leave "presents."
   - Submit the path by clicking the **Done** button.

2. **Passerby**:
   - The passerby spawns randomly on the right.
   - The exit spawns randomly on the left.
   - Click on an adjacent point to move the passerby one step at a time.
   - You have a maximum of 16 steps to reach the exit.
